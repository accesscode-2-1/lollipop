### Think piece discussion (team leader has prepared answers and guides discussion)

* What are 2 things you took from this think piece?
Amy Cuddy: Your body language shapes who you are
It's a very pracitcal thing to learn to read nonverbal communication. It is very powerufl. "Fake it till you make it" is a great way to be the person you want to be. 
More conscious now about posture and voice projection.
