### Retrospective

*Yulia**

* Last week’s goal - Get into Access Code.
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) - The application process went well. The workshop went well, too. Submission of web page.
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) - Challenge: While creating my webpage, I wanted my page to have sliding elements. I've done some coding, but I didn't have the time to incorporate other languages to make the elements movable. Lack of time to finish webpage.
* What is your goal for next week? Imporove github skills. Explore github inside out and get the basics for Java.
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) Become fluid in moving around in the terminal and GitHub.

**Reinard**

* Last week’s goal - Complete the webpage, submit and get into the program.
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) I was accepted on Wednesday. I met my goal.
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) I'm satisfied with what's going on; I did it on my own, but this was me doing the brunt work, following up, paying attention, being receptive to others ideas and thoughts, and staying humble. No matter how much you know, someone will know more than you.
* What is your goal for next week? To continue th same format; being humble, listen and absorb as much as I can and build with other like-minded people. 
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) Understanding code and syntax program. Clarity on programming in general.

**Lae**

* Last week’s goal - Get into the program and complete the webpage
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) - The application process was long, but at every stage, I felt confident. I got in!
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) I was nervous during the interview. I want to be more comfortable with that.
* What is your goal for next week? Get more comfortable with git. It's still a bit confusing. 
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) I'm not quite sure yet.

**Student 4**

* Last week’s goal - Getting in and make sure my page met my standards.
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) The interview process. I was nervous, but I had good chemistry with my interviewer. 
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) My webpage was a challenge. I had so many ideas I wanted to incorporate. Instead of focusing on the big picture, I got hung up on some smaller elements. 
* What is your goal for next week? Get better with git and git hub.
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) Git. 

**Charlyn**

* Last week’s goal - To get into the program and start a new chapter.
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) I think the application process went well. I'm really pleased with the face that that I learned a new skill (HTML).
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) I was really anxious while waiting to hear back. I was unfamiliar with HTML, so it was a challenge to find elements that were simple enough for me to understand, but pleasing to the eye. 
* What is your goal for next week? My goall is to explore git and practice moving about in the terminal.
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) I'm sure I will have a million questions once w start Java.

### Think piece discussion (team leader has prepared answers and guides discussion)

* What are 2 things you took from this think piece?
* Paola's peice:
* She was the picture of perserverance. She was an inspriation as she came from the program. We identified with her story
* Kevin's peice: It was great to hear that you don't need a four year degree to succeed in this. That particular part resonated with the group as we aren't coming from a formal programming background.
* They had very different stories and are both sucessful. Their journey; how they started, what it took for them to get where they are, all of it wass was valuable.
* How does this think piece relate to access code?
* Paola was a great example of what we can do with what we learn here. She learned everything she knew about mobile development through access code and used that to get a job she really likes.
