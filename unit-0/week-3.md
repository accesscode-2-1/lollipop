### Retrospective

**Charlyn**

* This week's Medium post: https://medium.com/@charlynbuchanan/brilliance-vs-grit-efc58abaf517
* Last week’s goal: To learn loops and finish the Choose Your Own Adventure game
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) Got plenty of practice in loops!
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) I wasn't able to finish the Hangman exercise in class, so that could've gone better.
* What is your goal for next week? Get comfortable with methods and working with more than one class.
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) My goals for next week!

**Reinard**

* This week's Medium post: 
* Last week’s goal: To get organized, to allocate time properly, to get over family tragedy (death), to finish homework.
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) The Hangman game went well -- I was able to call methods and understand what I was calling, what was being returned. It is easier for me to read code now.
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) I'm still having a hard time understanding some of the material. We're being introduced to major concepts (methods, classes, APIs) very quickly and I need more time to practice them.
* What is your goal for next week? To survive and stay on top of things.
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) The homework, Verbosity Calculator!

**Yuliya**

* This week's Medium post: https://medium.com/@YuliyaKaleda/classes-vs-objects-869a97e4bf2d
* Last week’s goal: To cover for and while loops, get familiar with the concept "method"
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) I feel very confident as far as for and while loops are concerned, methods...I feel I'll be able to incorporate them in any code in the future.
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) During the PrettyTitle exercise, I didn't have time to really work through incorporating all the exceptions.
* What is your goal for next week? Deepen understanding of how classes work, the combination of several classes, their communication and interconnection. I vaguely understand how it works right now.
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) As we move on, I need clarification as far as classes are concerned.

**Kadeem**

* This week's Medium post: https://medium.com/@Ksmaragh/struggle-for-thought-7db0006196cb
* Last week’s goal: to handle methods, to translate the game vision into actual code
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) Methods went well, classes went well, learning about objects, constructors.
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) Verbosity Calculator - I feel my solution wasn't the most efficient. I need to refine it.
* What is your goal for next week? Try to get better at reading API documentation.
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) API documentation.


**Jae**

* This week's Medium post: 
* Last week’s goal: To become more familiar with Git.
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) I've been able to push and pull successfully without instigating World War III, so that's an improvement!
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) I have hard time getting started and figuring out what I need to do efficiently. I also have the weird quirk of being able to understand complex things but getting tripped up on the simple/straightforward. These are time sinks. 
* What is your goal for next week? To improve at reading APIs efficiently and with LASER FOCUS(!!!) in order to work smarter.
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) Verbosity Calculator!
### Think piece discussion (team leader has prepared answers and guides discussion)

* What are 2 things you took from this think piece? We loved the circle of learning -- it helped us realize that everyone goes through the same process we do, and it's not an individual, personal thing. The emphasis on personal deadlines was something that spoke to me (Jae) -- it's something I need to be more on top of. "Motivation can trump frustration!" - Charlyn, who was also a sourpuss about this think piece!
* How does this think piece relate to access code? Everyone came here with a certain vision of their future. We're all like the author in the article, so hopefully we will end up as successful as he is!
