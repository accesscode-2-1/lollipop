* Last week’s goal?

		Learning how to read the API and understanding the documentation.

* What went well (what goals did you meet?)

		It’s been a rough week but I was able to familiarize myself with Arrays, Constructors and APIs.  

* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?)

		The Signboard project. Figuring out how to design my coordinates and getting help from my team mates.  

* What is your goal for next week?

		To revisit the class discussion on Constructors and Parameters.

* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can): 

		N/A

**Student**: Charlyn

* This week's Medium post: [waiting for submit]()

* Last week’s goal: 

		Learning more about Methods.

* What went well (what goals did you meet?):

		I was able to attend office hours and get help. In general, I'm feeling a lot better on how to approach a problem. Also, I'm feeling confident about my ability on how to break things up. 

* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?):

		Every assignment is a challenge for me. Especially, the Signboard. I could of had a better understanding of the program overall. 

* What is your goal for next week?:

		I would like to get my signboard working. I want to get better with mapping out Classes. The Classes is something I'm still trying to understand. 

* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can): 

		Methods and Constructors. 

**Student**: Yuliya

* This week's Medium post: [https://medium.com/@YuliyaKaleda/to-be-static-or-not-to-be-416194c09d3](https://medium.com/@YuliyaKaleda/to-be-static-or-not-to-be-416194c09d3)

* Last week’s goal: 

		Was to get introduce to Object and Classes and get a general idea of how they work. 

* What went well (what goals did you meet?): 

		I definitely figure out the Constructor and how they work. I'm trying to figure out how the Constructor is built and Operator. Get a better understanding of main methods. Priority of main method over other methods. 

* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?): 

		Break down the program into pieces and allocate methods to the proper classes. The TA was able to explain how to overcome my challenge. 

* What is your goal for next week?: 

		Get more practices with Classes and Objects. Get familiar with other variation of Arrays. 

* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can):

		N/A

**Student**: Kadeem

* This week's Medium post: []()

* Last week’s goal: 

		Trying to understand the API documentation. 

* What went well (what goals did you meet?):

		Signboard sorta went well. The drawing aspect come out better then expected. 

* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?): 

		The position of the signboard objects could of gone a little better. Collaborating with my team mates to help improve code. 

* What is your goal for next week?:

		I would like to revisit my text adventure game. 

* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can)

		N/A

**Student**: Reinard

* This week's Medium post: []()

* Last week’s goal: 

		Was to get focus and organized. 

* What went well (what goals did you meet?): 

		I was able to finish my homework on time (at least the programing aspect). I still need to complete my Medium post but more interested in understanding the coding aspect of everything. 

* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?): 

		More time on certain subjects. A chances to properly understand the material before moving on to the next subject. I'm having a hard problem with utilizing the finner details of what we learn. Overall, I can read what is going on, which is huge for me, considering it was foreign language to me about a month ago.  

* What is your goal for next week?

		During the Easter break I'm going to literately go over every module in the Unit 0 and compile all my project on Git hub. So, it's going to be a long week and weekend for me.

* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can)

		N/A


### Think piece discussion (team leader has prepared answers and guides discussion)

* What are 2 things you took from this think piece?

		There is a difference between feel you're wrong and releasing you're wrong.
		It hard to catch yourself because sometimes it feels like normal behavior.  

* How does this think piece relate to access code?

		Question everything.
