* Team Leader: Yuliya
* Think Piece: Grit

### Retrospective

**Student 1** Yuliya

* This week's medium post: https://medium.com/@YuliyaKaleda/success-and-challenge-go-together-a420e1b0c1b6
* Last week’s goal: to cover for and while loops, get familiar with the concept "method" 
* What went well (what goals did you meet?): loops usage, game creation and managing arrays;  
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) include methods in the game, polish game code
* What is your goal for next week? to cover classes and objects, finish next week HW, learn smth new about git
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) methods, need more practice on methods

**Student 2** Charlyn

* This week's medium post: https://medium.com/@charlynbuchanan/it-s-all-fun-or-games-f5640463e8f
* Last week’s goal: to learn loops and finish the game
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) confident about loops and able to debug loops, correctly structure code
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) incorporating methods in the game was tough; so the student asked questions during the review session, which was helpful
* What is your goal for next week? to become more confident with methods, to use them in the next home assignment, to finish Rocket task
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) more practice on methods

**Student 3** Kadeem

* This week's medium post: https://medium.com/@Ksmaragh/learning-git-frustration-1ca46fa9bd2
* Last week’s goal: to handle methods, to translate the game vision into actual code
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) confident about methods("They work as the should!"), improved git skills
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) game was a problem, had to change the game code half way through because was struggling with vectors
* What is your goal for next week? distinguish public and private notions, conquer vectors
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) vectors! 

**Student 4** Reinard

* This week's medium post: is still working on it
* Last week’s goal: to get organized, to allocate time properly, to get over family tragedy (death), to finish HW
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) nothing went well last week, there is a lot of confusion 
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) for and while loop usage; combining methods with loops
* What is your goal for next week? catch up with the class
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) need help with methods and for loops and their usage. Kadeem is to help to clarify the missing parts and thus will practice his teaching skills.

**Student 5** Jae

* This week's medium post: https://medium.com/@jaellysbales/here-be-dragons-60cd8e5313ef
* Last week’s goal:
* What went well (what goals did you meet?)
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?)
* What is your goal for next week?
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can)

### Think piece discussion (team leader has prepared answers and guides discussion)
1. Smth new you got from the talk: grit concept, IQ is not a decisive point
2. Was it just the speaker's opinion about the importance of grit or is it a scientifically proven fact? There has been some research conducted to prove grit priority over other things

* What are 2 things you took from this think piece? 
1. hard work and detrmination to achive smth;
2. high IQ is not the main key to success;

* How does this think piece relate to access code?
We have not done coding before, but working hard and consistanlty we can or better saying will get to the top of programming. 

### TODOs:
-help Reinard to catch up

### Extra comments / Anything you want your program managers to know: 
Reinard does not feel confident about new topics introduced this week and needs some help. Kadeem will render some assistance. 

### Next Week

* Next Week’s think piece: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kxSrPD__BA It may not be related directly to AC, but very inspirational.
* Next Week’s team leader: Jae
