### Retrospective

Reinard
* Last week’s goal - To practice Java, to read up on Android Studio
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) - I was able to look at video tutorials to get certain things completed, more self-directed learning.
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) - I wish we had a crash course in the layout of Android Studio itself, how to set up file structure for making intents/activities.
* What is your goal for next week? - Review material I'm getting from everyone, focus on abstract/interface/implements.
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) - How to keep track of file structure when making lots of classes/subclasses.

Charlyn
* Last week’s goal - practice ainheritance and interface, submit an application to Apple
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) - My app was what I wanted it to be, so I'm happy about that. I've been looking at Head First Java and it's been really good.
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) - Everything.
* What is your goal for next week? - I want to be more confident in navigating Android Studio, because that's still a mystery to me.
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) - Android Studio

Kadeem
* Last week’s goal - to get familiar with Android studio
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) - Starting to get a handle on where things go in Android Studio.
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) - Still a little unclear about the manifest. Abstract classes I'm still a little fuzzy on. Still running into some errors with inheritances.
* What is your goal for next week? - Become better at Android Studio, fixing gaps in my knowledge re: implementation of interfaces and abstract classes.
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) - Abstract classes, Android Studio.

Jae
* Last week’s goal - keep up with Android development
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) - My understanding has been very incremental, but it things are slowly starting to coalesce.
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) - Everything.
* What is your goal for next week? - Really finalize this knowledge of interfaces, etc. I am tired of not getting this at least 80%. For fun, read about Material Design guidelines.
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) - Knowing when to use an interface vs and abstract class for my game.

Yuliya
* Last week’s goal - practice interfaces
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) - I have a very good differentiated picture in my head of abstract classes/interface/implements, etc.
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) - I could've not have deleted my homework.
* What is your goal for next week? - To learn the basic components of Android projects. Not Android Studio, but things like activities. Read the documentation and understand what "actions" mean, etc.
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) - I'm good I think.
