### Think piece discussion (team leader has prepared answers and guides discussion)

* What are 2 things you took from this think piece?
*   - Becoming more conscious of our actions in relation to the ax-ees and becoming a more optimistic person.
*   - To change perspective is a very hard thing to do, focused on taking an objective stance and not taking anything personal.
* How does this think piece relate to access code?
*   - Relating to access code, not interpreting as I am bad at coding, just this specific instance is a temporary problem.
*
